## More about me:
I am a Minahasan woman who is passionate about connecting and mobilizing others in effort to create tangible and sustainable social innovation. I strive to combine empathy, compassion, critical thinking, and effectiveness for strategic interventions.

Having finished my undergraduate studies in forest management (policy division) and my research internships, I am guided by a commitment to DEI and am equipped with analytical skills. Moreover, I am adaptable and resourceful; this can be seen from my diverse experiences, from taking leadership roles in social projects, being a youth ambassador for North Sulawesi, working for human services, and more. 

In the long term, I aim to make my contribution to scaling social innovation that is more grounded, community-centric, impact-focused, and data-driven.
